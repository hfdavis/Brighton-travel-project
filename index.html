          <h3>
            Brighton, an inclusive, free-thinking city in the heart of Sussex.
          </h3>
          <p>
            a blend of modern culture and exotic architecture, sea and
            countryside, make Brighton your base and discover new places and
            experiences both inside the city and out. <br />
            <br />
            Ever since royal party animal George IV fell in love with Brighton
            back in the 18th Century, the city has been a magnet for visitors in
            search of fun, frolics and fresh sea air. With its majestic Regency
            squares and crescents, iconic Royal Pavilion and famous piers, today
            Brighton is as well-known for being a welcoming and diverse city
            with a passion for culture, creativity and sustainability as it is
            for its historic landmarks.
